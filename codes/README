This is the first code I uploaded to github and I am very happy. This is a short code which uses tensorflow to achieve conditional gan 
on the MNIST dataset. To run this code you need to install the python3 version, and install the tensorflow and numpy libraries, and also 
download the MNIST dataset on the web http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
